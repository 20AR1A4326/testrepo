software company
|- 3 things are required

1. degree
2. communication
3. 2 programming languages (c-language and java)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

c-language
----------
what is c-language?
--> c is a programming language, high level language and procedure oriented
    programming language.

what is a program?
--> a program is a set of instructions and a program is written to perform
    some task or operation.

#include<stdio.h>
#include<conio.h>

int main()
{
   int a, b, c;  -->  line or instruction
   clrscr();
   a = 10;
   b = 20;
   c = a + b;
   printf("%d",c);
   getch();
   return 1;
}

c --> programming language --> programs --> software/application --> task

--> c is a programming language and using programming language we write
    programs in order to develop or build software or application and using
    software or application we perform some task.

--> as c-language uses english words and it is user-friendly thats why c
    is called as high level language.

computer languages
------------------
--> computer languages are divided into 2 types

1. high level languages
2. low level languages
   i. assembly language
   ii. binary language (machine language)

--> the language which uses english words and which is user-friendly such
    language is called as high level language.

ex: c, c++, java, .net, python etc

--> the language which uses special symbols (MNEMONICS) such language is
    called as assembly language.

--> the language which uses only 0's and 1's and which is machine friendly
    such language is called as binary language or machine language.

--> as c-language follows the principles of procedure oriented programming
    paradigm thats why c-language is called as procedure oriented programm-
    ing language.

translators
-----------
what is a translator?
--> a translator is a software which converts one language into another
    language.

--> there are 3 types of translators

1. compiler
2. interpreter
3. assembler

--> compiler is a translator which converts high level language into binary
    language and it also reports errors (syntax errors) at compile time.

--> interpreter is a translator which converts high level language into
    binary language line by line.

--> assembler is a translator which converts assembly language into binary
    language.

note:
1. all high level languages use either compiler or interpreter.

2. only assembly language uses assembler.

3. c-language uses compiler.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

c --> procedure oriented programming language

java --> object oriented programming language

aspectj --> aspect oriented programming language

what is procedure oriented programming (pop)?
--> procedure oriented programming is a programming paradigm.

--> a programming paradigm is also called as programming methodology.

paradigm means principles

principles of pop
-----------------
--> in procedure oriented programming, the program is divided into multiple
    sub tasks and every sub task is written inside the function or procedure.

note: the advantage of using function is code reusability.

what is object oriented programming (oop)?
--> object oriented programming is a programming paradigm.

--> a programming paradigm is also called as programming methodology.

principles of oop
-----------------
1. class
2. object
3. data hiding
4. abstraction
5. encapsulation
6. inheritance (is-a relationship)
7. composition (has-a relationship)
8. polymorphism

--> as java follows the principles of object oriented programming paradigm
    thats why java is called as object oriented programming language.

what is aspect oriented programming (aop)?
--> aspect oriented programming is a programming paradigm.

--> a programming paradigm is also called as programming methodology.

principles of aop
-----------------
1. aspect
2. advice
3. join point
4. point cut
5. weaving
6. target
7. proxy

--> as aspectj follows the principles of aspect oriented programming para-
    digm thats why aspectj is called aspect oriented programming language.

programming paradigms (programming methodologies)
---------------------
1. procedure oriented programming (pop)
2. object oriented programming (oop)
3. aspect oriented programming (aop)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

number systems
--------------
what is a number system?
--> a number system is a technique or a system to represent the numbers in
    the computer system.

--> there are 4 number systems

1. decimal number system
2. octal number system
3. hexadecimal number system
4. binary number system

decimal means 10
octal means 8
hexadecimal means 16
binary means 2

decimal number system
---------------------
base	-	10
range	-	0 to 9

ex: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 59, 100, 123, 1000, 12345 etc

octal number system
-------------------
base	-	8
range	-	0 to 7
